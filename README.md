# Atmosphere-Pack
This is just a simple pack with all the bare minimum stuff for Atmosphere, Switch

This "pack" contains all the stuff for Atmosphere, the best custom firmware for Nintendo Switch.

This contains Atmosphere, Hekate, Latest Sig Patches, TegraRcmGui, Fat32 Format Gui and a guide made by me.

                       *NOTE THE GUIDE DOES NOT CONTAIN INFO ON HOW TO INSTALL EMUNAND*

The requirements for this are:
1. An unpatched switch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqQ70vesM_Y Guide made by Franklin) 
2. An RCMJig (https://www.amazon.ie/RCM-Clip-Connector-Modification-3D-Printed/dp/B07J5XF1NH?crid=2QPLGII03XKON&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.24Z7W0q_17h1KiHIW1mCXdS8GikQQdvRB36aQIK_-8dyShhwNlYvG5mpPYwzXGtC6KtMH8PH__H1ghLGm8hAWH6am70rJrQqR0_Q8MVwZSN52M4GyjjYAYWHeoevWe9XpgSP_UZdqvmFqTQYCTYO_og-lBnh_HircPk_YiJKR3IhJMTo2dd5E1ak2CnpXy3QxKNaykFauE4aSJdZpe_oa8FBCRK7LuWIZWumKfbFJxEUQEBOQeB9MR8WPI0okbVwvv-d_adn5rkAJoZ32dIxqrpfhDCAJJew41D3Fb37HRw.U8VxAf020xO5P3RaFOnFB7pe31C_doZwnjdtSY8T1Jk&dib_tag=se&keywords=RCM%2Bjig&qid=1744466852&sprefix=rcm%2Bjig%2Caps%2C69&sr=8-1&th=1)
3. A computer running Windows 10/11
4. A Micro SD for the Switch (Preferably at least 64gb)
5. USB-C Type cable

The contents of the pack will be updated by me if something in the pack (such as Atmosphere of Hekate or Sig Patches) get an update.
